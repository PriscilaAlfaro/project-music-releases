# Week 9-Technigo bootcamp 

# Music Releases

This project was made on week 9 for Technigo bootcamp as a pair-programming project (by Priscila Alfaro Segura & Julia Nikitina).
The goal was to create a "New Releases" music site using data from Spotify and display album and single releases. We practiced with React and used several components to achieve it.  

## The problem

We approached the problem by building only one component Album at first, which we rendered using .map() and passed the album data using props, more concretely we destructured our props so we did not need to write the props parameter when using them. 
But then we realised that we needed one more component for Artists to fetch the data correctly and display the link for each artist if it was more than one that worked on album.
We easily achieved blue level, so we went for red and some assignements for black level to display Playlists also in a sidebar on the left.  
We styled our website with flexbox to make it responsive.
